SELECT sum(population)FROM population_years WHERE country = "United States" OR country = "China" OR country = "India";
ANSWER = 41,604,874,680

Question 2 There should be a separate entity for country,population and year.
country should have fields like id,country_name,continent
population should have fields like id,country_id, year_id, population, year

SELECT DISTINCT year FROM population_years;
SELECT country,population,year FROM population_years WHERE country = "Gabon" ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM population_years WHERE year = 2005  ORDER BY population LIMIT 10;
SELECT country,population,year FROM population_years WHERE year = 2010 AND population > 100;
SELECT DISTINCT count(*) FROM population_years WHERE country like "%islands%" GROUP BY "country" LIMIT 1;
SELECT country,population,year FROM population_years WHERE country = "Indonesia" AND year = 2000 OR  country = "Indonesia" AND year = 2010;
SELECT sum(population) FROM population_years WHERE country != "United States" AND country != "China" AND country != "India" AND year = 2010;
SELECT sum(population) FROM population_years WHERE country NOT IN ("United States","China" ,"India") AND year = 2010;

//sub Query
 SELECT sum(population) FROM population_years  WHERE country IN (SELECT
 DISTINCT country FROM population_years WHERE country LIKE "%Islands%")
 AND year = 2010;

 SELECT workers.name,roles.role,activities.name,activities.start_date,
activities.end_date FROM projects INNER JOIN workers ON
projects.wrk_id = workers.id INNER JOIN roles ON projects.role_id = roles.id 
INNER JOIN activities ON projects.act_id = activities.id

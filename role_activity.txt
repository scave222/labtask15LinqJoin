Lab Task 2 - ER Modelling
Submission: 2.00 p.m
Softhills Technologies is an IT company located in Lagos. They recently secured a contract with a construction company to develop a Project Scheduling System using the following business rules;
1) A project has a name, a city, and a state.
2) An activity has a name, a starting date and ending date. An activity may be design, construction, quality assurance, etc.
3) Each activity belongs to a single project, but a project may have one or more activities.
4) A worker has a name.  Workers may be assigned to several projects and they have a specific role in each project, but the role may be different on each project. (Roles are different than activities.)
5) Several workers may be working on the same project.
6) There is a list of possible roles a worker may have in a project.  (A workerâ€™s role must be on this list.)  The possible roles a worker may have are construction worker, manager, supervisor, or office management. 
You are a new intern in the company and have been assigned to develop an E/R model of the database using the highlighted business rules.
